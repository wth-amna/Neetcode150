Software -> program -> process = yeh teeno ek hi terms hain.

process -> running program, joh memory (RAM) mai currently available ho.

software/program is set of instructions that can be executed by computer (very basic)
but acc to software engineer.
software/program is some lines of code that do some work (manipulation, manage, analysis, etc..) on data

thats why..
we should learn how to write *code* as well as how to manipulate *data*.


Pseudocode -> plain language description of the algorithm steps

its not standardized thats why it could create confusions if share with other people
so we have flowcharts (standard set by ANSI) that represent the flow graphically to any technical person, 
so anyone could understand whats would be the flow of algorithm
where and who use flowcharts?
 - used by software developers, Business analysts, project managers
 - suitable for module-level working and shows internal logic of a single function
 - not ideal for the large system qk kafi complex or cluttered ho jaty hain
flowchart lacks software modeling (steps konsy hongy, konsa model lagyga..waterfall, agile etc)
can't provide detailed overview of the events (ager ghlt input dydiya tou kia)
No object-oriented support: (classes, inheritance etc..nahi show karpaty)
Sirf process flow dikhate hainâ€”na system structure, na interactions. (ky kiss ny login kiya admin ya user etc)

thats why we have UML (check what is UML.txt)
