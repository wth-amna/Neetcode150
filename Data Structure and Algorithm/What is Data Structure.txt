Structures contain data so we can organize it, store and manage the data efficiently in the memory.
Example: Array, Stacks, Queues

Whats the difference in data structure and database?

Data Structures are used within programs to store data temporarily in memory(RAM) and manipulate it efficiently.
it is managed by code
Databases are used to store large amounts of data permanently (in persistent storage or hard disk) and provide tools to manage and access it.
it is managed by dbms (Oracle, MYSQL etc)
